.SH DESCRIPTION
.B debugapp
is a tool that helps you start or find applications by name in debugging mode. It acts as a wrapper around

.B \-\-debug
option; we recommend using openapp directly.
.P
By default gdb is used as the debugger, but this can be changed with the
.B \-\-gdb=
option or through the
.B GDB
enviroment variable.

The
.I arguments
are the arguments passed to the application.
