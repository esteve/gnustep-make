.SH NAME
openapp \- launch applications from the command line

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B openapp
.RB [ \-\-find ] 
.RB [ \-\-debug " [" \-\-gdb=
.IR debuger "]] [" 
.BI \-\-library-combo= library-combo
] 
.I application
.RI [ arguments... ] 

.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.B openapp
command allows you to launch graphical GNUstep applications from the command line.
.PP
.I application
is the complete or relative name of the application program with or without the .app extension, like
.B Ink.app. 
.PP
.I arguments
are the arguments passed to the application.
.PP
.B openapp
first checks whether the application is in the current working directory.  If not then searches the GNUstep domains' Applications folders in the following order:
User
.RI "(i.e. " ~/GNUstep/Applications ),
Local, Network, System. First match wins.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-\-find " application"
will print out the full path of the application executable which would be executed, without actually executing it. It will also list all paths that are attempted.
.TP
.BI \-\-debug " application"
starts the application in the debugger. By default
.BR gdb ,
but this can be changed with the
.B \-\-gdb=
argument or through the 
.B GDB
shell variable.
.TP
.BI \-\-library-combo= library-combo
Starts the application with the specified library combo. This is a rarely used option in a non-flattened setup. See the
.BR library-combo (7)
man-page for more information about the different library combinations.
.TP
.B \-\-help
print above usage description.

.SH EXAMPLES
Start
.B Ink.app
without additional parameters:
.PP
.B openapp Ink.app 
.PP
Launch
.B Ink.app
and pass it the
.B \-\-debug
argument:
.PP
.B openapp \-\-debug Ink.app
.PP
To determine which executable is launched by openapp, type: 
.PP
.B openapp \-\-find Ink.app
.PP
The output of the above command might be something like:
.I /usr/GNUstep/Local/Applications/Ink.app/Ink

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B GNUSTEP_CONFIG_FILE
is used to determine where the
.B GNUstep.sh
configuration file is located. If the variable is not set
.B openapp
tries to locate it in the folder where
.B openapp
was started, then in the user domain, and as a last resort in the system domain (or actually the place you configured
.RI ( \-\-with-config-file= )
during building).
.TP
.B GDB
Sets the debugger to use when
.B \-\-debug
is used.
