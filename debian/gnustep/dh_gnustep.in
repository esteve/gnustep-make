=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<dh_gnustep> [S<I<debhelper options>>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

dh_gnustep is a program based on debhelper that is responsible for doing
GNUstep-specific modifications.

dh_gnustep makes the following changes:

=over 4

=item GNUstep dependencies:

Adds any extra dependencies needed for GNUstep.  Currently, the only dependency
added is to ensure that the package uses the same filesystem layout as the
other GNUstep packages installed on the system.

=back

=head1 OPTIONS

dh_gnustep accepts the common debhelper options.

If the DEB_GNUSTEP_NO_MOVE environment variable is set to a non-empty, non-zero
value, then dh_gnustep exits without doing anything.

Should remove library_paths.openapp and stamp.make files.

Doesn't really do the right thing with info files (should call install-info).

=cut

foreach my $package (@{$dh{DOPACKAGES}}) {
	# make each package depend on the GNUstep filesystem layout that it was
	# built with
	addsubstvar($package, "gnustep:Depends", "@GS_FS_PACKAGE@");
}

exit 0;
