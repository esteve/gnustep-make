gnustep-make is the GNUstep building system.  It's a makefile library
that allows you to write powerful, robust and portable makefiles very
quickly.  Traditionally it is used to build and install GNUstep software.

Most common targets:
 _MAKE_ all (builds)
 _MAKE_ install (builds and installs)
 _MAKE_ uninstall (uninstalls)
 _MAKE_ clean (deletes built files)
 _MAKE_ distclean (deletes all built files)
 _MAKE_ dist (creates a .tar.gz of the software sources)

Most common options that can be used with any of the targets:
 messages=yes (prints verbosely all commands being executed)
 debug=no (turns off generation of debug symbols)
 strip=yes (strips executables and objects before installing)
 shared=no (builds static executable and objects)
 GNUSTEP_INSTALLATION_DOMAIN=SYSTEM/LOCAL/NETWORK/USER (installs 
   in the specified domain; the default is LOCAL)
 MAKEFILE_NAME=xxx (uses makefiles called 'xxx'; the default is
   'GNUmakefile'.  Note that usually you'd use this option as in 
   '_MAKE_ -f xxx MAKEFILE_NAME=xxx'.)
 internalmessages=yes (prints verbosely all the recursive make
   invocations.  Useful for debugging gnustep-make itself.)
You can use multiple of these options at the same time.

Examples:

 _MAKE_ messages=yes
   Builds the software and prints verbosely the commands that are
   being used (useful for debugging)

 _MAKE_ install GNUSTEP_INSTALLATION_DOMAIN=USER
   Builds the software and installs it into your user domain (normally
   in the GNUstep directory of your home directory).  Note that you 
   need to source GNUstep.sh to be able to use software installed
   in your user domain.

 _MAKE_ install strip=yes messages=yes
   Builds and installs the software and strips executables and object
   files before installing.  It also prints verbosely the commands
   being executed.

# TODO:
# For more information, please check ... ?
#
# We really need a proper user-facing manual that explains how
# to use GNUmakefiles from a user/packager point of view.  Then
# we could link it from here.
